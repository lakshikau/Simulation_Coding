Research and Development
Coding Physics in C. MinGW Developer Studio (IDE for C). Renderer: OVITO.
Coded in native C language to calculate the position of the particles in each frame using physics equations.
Bouncing simulation 
Each sphere has a randomly assigned value for the “coefficient of restitution” (e). A constant downward force is applied. Position is calculated in ‘Y’ direction.
Swarming simulation 
Central constant attraction force with a linear decay applied. Each sphere has a randomly assigned mass. Particles are not affected by each other. Position is calculated in all three axes.
